### Technologies Used:
* JavaScript
* Phaser.io
* GIMP
* Stitches

### Issues: 
* Learning Phaser framework
* Enemy automated bullet firing on level 2 

### Unresolved Problems:
* Collision detection bugs on level 2 with enemy bullets
* Google fonts loading after text is created on first play
* Player sprites have too much padding around the image, making the collision detection more sensitive than it should be. 

### Next Steps:
* fix unresolved problems
* continue testing for bugs 
* add boss level
